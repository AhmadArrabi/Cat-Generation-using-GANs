In this project I applied a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of cats based on some training samples. The referenced architecture, DCGAN, was from a paper titled “UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS”. The training was done on approximately 4600 images of size 64x64, the generated images were impressive and were really close to the real ones.
